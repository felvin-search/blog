Last weekend at Felvin, we hosted an open source hackathon on instant apps. The purpose was twofold, one to give students a little nudge to create instant apps, two to stress test our instant apps system and see how easy it is for people to create instant apps. Happy to call the Hackathon a success on both fronts. Each participant created 4.5 instant apps on average in less than 48 hours. Either the participants were very motivated or we made it very easy for them to create the instant apps or both üòâ.

These days I'm engrossed in Hacktoberfest, and it's been both hectic and fun, and of course full of learning! Thanks to this project, I learnt how to write styled components, and brushed up my React skills this weekend.
